# HP-Keyboards-Suck

So, my HP laptop keyboard was apparently damaged. I play racing games a lot on my keyboard (don't judge), which means that I use the W key a lot of times to accelerate my car. THe problem is that the more I play, the less the W key seems to work, after like 15 minutes. 
The Specific problem? Even when I unpress the W key, the laptop thinks it is still pressed for some unbeknownst reason. 
I am too broke to repair my whole ass laptop keyboard. Plus services in this country are absolutley dogshit.
So, I made this shitty progam where you can press 'S' or '/' and it will forecfully tell windows that the W key has been unpressed.
